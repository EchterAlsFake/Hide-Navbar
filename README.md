*# NavTweaks (former Fullscreen/Immersive gestures) 10-15

![](https://i.imgur.com/vcXAreJ.png)

This Magisk Module lets you tweak the appearence of Android 10-15's navigation bar.

## Requirements
- Android 10-15
- Magisk 20+ or KernelSU (likely Apatch as well)

## Installation 
1. Flash the module
2. Select the desired options on the volume selector
3. Reboot
4. Enjoy!

## Disclaimer
- GSI compabitility isn't guaranteed due to Magisk's inconsistent GSI support
- Navbar coloring (getting light/dark) doesn't work on Android 11+ (using the Coloring fix/workaround option may fix it but it's not guaranteed)
- KernelSU users need to add the SystemUI app to the root list (no need to grant root access, just make sure unmount modules is disabled to it)
